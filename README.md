# dotfiles

currently this only works on arch-based distros because I'm still figuring out bash scripting
packages installed: nodejs, npm, neovim, tmux, ranger

```
git clone https://github.com/helpitsagain/dotfiles
```

```
cd dotfiles
```

```
chmod +x script.sh
```

```
. config.sh
```

it should keep a back up copy of any conflicting files but proceed with caution
